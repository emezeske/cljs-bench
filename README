# cljs-bench

Runs the benchmarks in
test-scaffold/cljs-bench/cljs/benchmark_runner.cljs against checkouts
of Clojurescript and summarizes the results as an html report with
plots. See http://50ply.com/cljs-bench/ for an example.

## Usage

Assumes you already have a working Clojurescript that was cloned from
git. Create a file named last-head inside your copy of cljs-bench and
put the SHA1 of the earliest version you care about in this file.

Then, if using leiningen:

lein run ~/src/clojurescript/ report

This will check out and run the benchmarks in every version of
clojurescript between the version you mentioned and origin/master of
the local clojurescript repository you pointed cljs-bench at. When its
done it will update the last-head file to point at the current
location of origin/master. To perform incremental updates, just fetch
into your local clojurescript repo and run the above command again.
