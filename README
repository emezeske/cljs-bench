# cljs-bench

Runs the benchmarks in
test-scaffold/cljs-bench/cljs/benchmark_runner.cljs against checkouts
of Clojurescript and summarizes the results as an html report with
plots. See http://50ply.com/cljs-bench/ for an example.

## Usage

Make sure you have at least one of these environment variables
defined:

# V8_HOME (location of the d8 binary)
# SPIDERMONKEY_HOME (location of the js binary)
# JSC_HOME (location of the jsc binary)

Also, make sure you have a recent version of Gnuplot on your PATH.

This assumes you already have a working Clojurescript that was cloned
from git. Make sure you've run the clojurescript bootstrap script
(script/bootstrap) to download Clojure and the Closure
compiler. Create a file named last-head inside your copy of cljs-bench
and put the SHA1 of the earliest version you care about in this file.

Then, if using leiningen:

lein run ~/src/clojurescript/ report

This will check out and run the benchmarks in every version of
clojurescript between the version you mentioned and origin/master of
the local clojurescript repository you pointed cljs-bench at. When its
done it will update the last-head file to point at the current
location of origin/master. To perform incremental updates, just fetch
into your local clojurescript repo and run the above command again.
